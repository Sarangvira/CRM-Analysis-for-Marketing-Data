## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Iâ€™m a data analyst, and the Chief Marketing Officer has told me that previous marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. I need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

## BRIEF

1. Performed `Data Exploration` and `Segmentation` to study the key characteristic features of `Potential customers` using Python.
2. Executed `Hypothesis Testing`, `Statistical Analysis`, `Anomaly Detection and Trend Analysis`, and `Feature Engineering` to identify sequential demand patterns and Customer Behavior.
3. Calculated the top 10 Informative features using `Random Forest Feature Importance`.
4. Detected `Successful Marketing Channels` and `Underperforming Marketing Campaigns`.
5. Designed Interactive dashboards using `Flourish` to analyze the trends, give recommendations and publish the findings.
